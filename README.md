It looks like you have a set of commands that you want to run as part of your AWS EC2 instance user data script to set up dependencies for your CodeDeploy deployment. This script is typically used when launching an EC2 instance to automatically configure the instance.

Here's how you can structure your user data script:

#!/bin/bash
sudo yum -y update
sudo yum -y install ruby
sudo yum -y install wget

# Change to the desired directory
cd /home/ec2-user

# Download and install AWS CodeDeploy agent
wget https://aws-codedeploy-ap-south-1.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/latest/install
sudo chmod +x ./install
sudo ./install auto

# Install Python and pip
sudo yum install -y python3-pip

# Install AWS CLI using pip
sudo pip3 install awscli

# Download and install AWS CodeDeploy agent

# Install AWS CLI using pip
sudo pip3 install awscli
Explanation:

Update Packages: sudo yum -y update updates all installed packages to their latest versions.

Install Ruby and Wget: sudo yum -y install ruby installs Ruby, and sudo yum -y install wget installs the wget utility.

Change Directory: cd /home/ec2-user changes the current directory to /home/ec2-user. You can replace this with the directory where you want to execute your deployment.

Download and Install CodeDeploy Agent: The next three commands download the AWS CodeDeploy agent installation script, make it executable, and then run it in automatic mode.

Install Python and pip: sudo yum install -y python3-pip installs Python and pip for managing Python packages.

Install AWS CLI: Finally, sudo pip3 install awscli installs the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) using pip.

Make sure to test your script on a new EC2 instance to ensure that it works as expected. Also, note that the AWS CLI is installed using pip3 because the Python package manager has been changed to pip3 in more recent versions.
